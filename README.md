[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/fairscale/badge/?version=latest)](https://fairscale.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)  

Research in the 1960s and 1970s produced the first problem-solving program, or expert system, known as Dendral. While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry, it provided the basis for a subsequent system MYCIN, considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine .

The 1980s and 1990s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity. During this time, there was a recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physicians. Approaches involving fuzzy set theory, Bayesian networks, and artificial neural networks,have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare. 

Various specialties in medicine have shown an increase in research regarding AI. As the novel coronavirus ravages through the globe, the United States is estimated to invest more than $2 billion in AI related healthcare research over the next 5 years, more than 4 times the amount spent in 2019 ($463 million).

## OUR INITIATIVE :
* We purpose a portal that has all possible solutions to Medical problems.
* It tries to remove the barrier between what factors effect the problem.
* We purpose simple and handy website using Machine Learning algorithms.


## HOW TO GET STARTED ?
Let's first understand the directory structure .

#### Directory Layout
